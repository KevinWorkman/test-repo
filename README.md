This repo is me playing around with Google's Cloud Shell [tutorial feature](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/tutorials). I'll probably delete it after I figure out the basics, so please don't rely on this for anything.

This repo contains the projects you'll work on throughout CodeU.

## Setup

After you meet your team on chat, decide who will setup your shared GitHub repo.

That person should click here:

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/KevinWorkman/test-repo.git&cloudshell_tutorial=week-0-setup/intro.md)

Then follow the on-screen instructions to setup your team's repo.
